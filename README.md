▌Capsule and Hyperbolic Polyhedron

Using COMPAS Data Structure Mesh with a python script to generate a virtual sculpture in Computational Geometry. 
Locate the points of mesh distributed in space with hyperbolic parabolic surface, then generate polyhedron with random radius, vertices & faces according to point coordinates, to obtain hyperbolic parabolic surface asteroid belt with single solid mesh, non-manifold edges and self-intersecting. The polyhedrons were subdivided into a mesh with the Catmull–Clark algorithm. The Catmull–Clark scheme is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to create curved surfaces by using subdivision surface modeling.

▌Random Walk Capsule

This part generates a 3D model of a random walk using the COMPAS library. A random walk is a mathematical model that describes a path that consists of a series of random steps. In this case, the random steps are simulated using a stochastic process that generates random vectors in 3D space. The resulting path is represented as a sequence of capsules, which are 3D shapes that consist of a cylinder and two hemispheres on each end.
