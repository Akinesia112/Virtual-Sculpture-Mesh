# Virtual-Sculpture-Mesh

▌Introduction

Using COMPAS Data structure Mesh with a python script to generate a virtual sculpture in Computational Geometry. 
Locate the points distributed in space with hyperbolic parabolic surface, then generate polyhedron with random radius, vertices & faces according to point coordinates, to obtain hyperbolic parabolic surface asteroid belt with single solid mesh, non-manifold edges and self-intersecting. The polyhedrons were subdivided into a mesh with the Catmull Clark scheme. The Catmull–Clark algorithm is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to create curved surfaces by using subdivision surface modeling.
