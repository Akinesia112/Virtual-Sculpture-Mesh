# ual_Sculpture-Capsule-Hyperbolic_Polyhedron

▌Introduction

Using COMPAS Data Structure Mesh with a python script to generate a virtual sculpture in Computational Geometry. 
Locate the points of mesh distributed in space with hyperbolic parabolic surface, then generate polyhedron with random radius, vertices & faces according to point coordinates, to obtain hyperbolic parabolic surface asteroid belt with single solid mesh, non-manifold edges and self-intersecting. The polyhedrons were subdivided into a mesh with the Catmull–Clark algorithm. The Catmull–Clark scheme is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to create curved surfaces by using subdivision surface modeling.
